### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , This is the greatest league in fantasy footballs Beer olympics Random Team genorator** 


#### using... ðŸ§°

The front end will run on a React framework to handle the multi-dimensional aspects of our Beer olympics. The most important thing to get going is the random team genorator. After that I can expand and make a scoreboard to keep track throughout the day.   

Back end is unknown at the moment. I might give a shot at Django or stick to something a little easier and use MongoDB since we wont have many relations across objects.
